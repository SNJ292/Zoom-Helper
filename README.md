### Inspiration
When entering this project we all had one common issue with the way classes were formed, and that was the long task of getting into the zoom meeting. Our solution to this made it so accessible that even children who have to attend class during this pandemic would be able to utilize it.

### What it does
Our Google extension acts as a bookmark for recurring zoom meetings by allowing users to save meeting IDs or Zoom Links of their courses that are now online due to COVID.

### How we built it
We utilized a mixture of CSS and HTML.

### Challenges we ran into
For some of us, we did not feel strong in our CSS skills, and for others, communication wasn't necessarily their strong suit. However, we eventually found out footing and conquered this project together.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take great pride in its simple and easy to use interface as well as how we were able to add additional features as we progressed through the project.

### What we learned
For some of us, our CSS skills were strengthened, and for others, we learned how to effectively communicate.

### What's next for Zoom Helper Google extension
We would love to take this to the next level by making it aesthetically pleasing and possible implement code to run alongside the zoom application.
